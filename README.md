**DunderMifflin Compulsory Assignment.**
Hi Alex,
So i tried to fix my app but I encounter some errors and spend last 2 days trying to fix, but I still cannot. I am really at a dead end and cannot fix it, of course on Monday I will ask you face to face about them.

To run the app:
(for backend)
docker compose up --build
cd backend
dotnet ef database update
dotnet run
(for frontend)
npm run dev
